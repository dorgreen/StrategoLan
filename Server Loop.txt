--------
Game's /State/ should be new subclasses of Game with one method: HandlePacket()
Using the State Design Pattern
--------


Server Loop:

	 ==> Should be with server.SendDiscoveryResponse()
	Wait for connection:
		Connected:
			-> "You are playerN"
		Wait for N-1:
			-> "Await N-1"
		Two Connected:
			-> "Press Start"
	Wait for Start:
		Wait for start on both players
			-> reply with "Await start"
			-> reply with "Waiting player"

	Wait for Board Init:
		wait for 1
		wait for 2
			-> Send both the complete board


---------------------------------------------
$ Take care of these later... $

	Game Loop:
		Wait for input from playerN
			-> Don't accept any other game input
			-> If action is illegal don't operate / reply error
			-> if action is legal: perform, send new board to both
			-> If game over: break to GAMEOVER loop
			-> Wait for input from player1-N

		Game Over:
			-> Send both player info on that
			-> Wait for start
